# imports: json

# hardcoded variables for the functions

# call function to get data from API => create python dictionary object (lets call this raw_data)
#   (this will need the lat and long of the area, I will hardcode this to Salt Lake City)
# call function to clean data => create python dict (lets call this clean_data)
#   (this will need a list of items the user wants to keep, I will hardcode this)
#   (this will also need the dictionary from the API data)
# call function to change data => create python dict (lets call this changed_data)

# use the json dumps feature to change the changed_data dict to JSON output
# save this new JSON data (lets call this json_finished_data)

# print that the object was succesfully created
