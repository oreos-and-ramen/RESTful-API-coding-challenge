# i dont want any of the internal data such as generationtime so I will clear all of that
# for simplicities sake, I look through the dict and save things I want, and ignore the things I don't

# function: clean_data
# input: list of information to keep, API data (uncleaned) dict
# output: python dict
# ==================================
# create new (empty) dict
# iterate through the uncleaned dict
#   if the key matches something on the keep list, add it to the new dict
#   ignore if it doesn't

# return the new dict
